## ðŸ“˜ Problem Summary
The challenge is to:
- Read a line of input from the user.
- Print "Hello, World." on the first line.
- Print the input you received on the second line.

This problem is a warm-up to get familiar with input/output handling in your chosen programming language.

## ðŸ’¡ My Approach
- I used `console.log()` to output the fixed message "Hello, World."
- Then I printed the input string received via `readLine()` (in JavaScript).
- This ensures proper separation of fixed and dynamic output.
