# Day 01 â€“ Data Types

ðŸ”— [View the problem on HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types/problem?isFullScreen=true)

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Summary
The challenge is to:
- Declare and initialize predefined variables: an integer, a double, and a string.
- Read and store an integer, a double, and a string from user input.
- Print the sum of both integers on one line.
- Print the sum of both doubles (rounded to 1 decimal) on the second line.
- Print the concatenated strings on the third line.

This problem reinforces understanding of data types and basic input/output handling.

## ðŸ’¡ My Approach
- I used `parseInt()` and `parseFloat()` to convert the input strings to numbers.
- Used `.toFixed(1)` to round the float addition to one decimal.
- Concatenated strings using `+` operator and printed all outputs with `console.log()`.

## âœ… Status
Solved and passed all test cases on HackerRank.
