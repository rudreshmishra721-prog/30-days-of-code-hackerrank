## ðŸ“˜ Problem Summary
The challenge is to:
- Calculate the total meal cost including tip and tax.
- You're given the meal cost, tip percentage, and tax percentage as inputs.
- Print the total cost rounded to the nearest integer.

This problem builds on working with numbers, arithmetic, and rounding in JavaScript.

## ðŸ’¡ My Approach
- Calculated tip as `meal_cost * (tip_percent / 100)`.
- Calculated tax as `meal_cost * (tax_percent / 100)`.
- Added all three to get the `total_cost`.
- Used `Math.round()` to round the final amount before printing.
