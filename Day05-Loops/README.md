# Day 05 â€“ Loops

ðŸ”— [View the problem on HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-loops/problem?isFullScreen=true)

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Summary
The challenge is to:
- Read an integer `n` from input.
- Print its multiplication table for values from `1` through `10`.

Each line must follow this format:  
`n x i = result`  
Where `i` is from 1 to 10.

This problem reinforces loop usage and basic output formatting.

## ðŸ’¡ My Approach
- Used a `for` loop to iterate from `1` to `10`.
- Inside the loop, printed the formatted string using template literals.
- Ensured output matches exactly what HackerRank expects.

## âœ… Status
Solved and passed all test cases on HackerRank.
