# Day 06 â€“ Let's Review

ðŸ”— [View the problem on HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-review-loop/problem?isFullScreen=true)

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Summary
The challenge is to:
- Read an integer `T` denoting the number of test cases.
- For each string input, print two strings:
  - One containing characters at even indices.
  - One containing characters at odd indices.
- Output them separated by a space on a new line for each string.

This problem practices string manipulation and working with indices using loops.

## ðŸ’¡ My Approach
- Parsed the number of test cases.
- Iterated over each string using a loop.
- Used the modulus operator to split characters by even and odd indices.
- Stored them in separate variables and printed them using template literals.

## âœ… Status
Solved and passed all test cases on HackerRank.
