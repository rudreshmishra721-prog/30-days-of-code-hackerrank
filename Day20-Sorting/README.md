# Day 20 â€“ Sorting

ðŸ”— [View the problem on HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-sorting/problem?isFullScreen=true)

## ðŸ“˜ Problem Summary
We need to implement **Bubble Sort** on an array of integers.  
The program should:
1. Count the total number of swaps made while sorting.
2. Print:
   - Total swaps
   - First element (after sorting)
   - Last element (after sorting)

---

## ðŸ’¡ My Approach
- Implemented **Bubble Sort**:
  - Repeatedly traversed the array.
  - Swapped adjacent elements if they were in the wrong order.
  - Counted swaps in a variable `numSwaps`.
- Optimization:
  - If no swaps were made during a pass, the algorithm stops early.
- Printed results in the required format.
