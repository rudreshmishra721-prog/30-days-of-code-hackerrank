## ðŸ“˜ Problem Summary
Given integers `N` and `K`:
- Find the **maximum value of `A & B`** (bitwise AND) such that:
  - `1 â‰¤ A < B â‰¤ N`
  - Result `< K`.

---

## ðŸ’¡ My Approach
- First I thought of checking all pairs `(A, B)` using loops â†’ but that would be **O(NÂ²)** and too slow for large inputs.
- Then I realized:
  - The maximum possible result should be close to `K-1`.
  - If `(K-1)` can be achieved by some pair within the limit `N`, thatâ€™s the answer.
  - Otherwise, the next possible answer is `K-2`.
- To check achievability, I used the trick:
  ```
  if ((K - 1) | K) <= N â†’ answer = K - 1
  else â†’ answer = K - 2
  ```

---

## Key Insight
- Brute force = **O(NÂ²)** â†’ too slow.
- Instead:
  - The best possible answer is `K-1` (largest number below `K`).
  - Check if `(K-1) | K <= N`:
    - If true â†’ `K-1` is achievable.
    - Else â†’ best possible is `K-2`.

---

## Pseudocode
```
function bitwiseAnd(N, K):
    if ((K-1) | K) <= N:
        return K-1
    else:
        return K-2
```

## Example Input
```
3
5 2
8 5
2 2
```

## Example Output
```
1
4
0
```

---

## Key Learning
- Bitwise optimization replaces brute force.
- The **`|` (bitwise OR)** trick helps check if `K-1` is achievable.
- Always aim for patterns rather than testing every pair.
